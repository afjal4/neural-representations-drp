# Neural Representations Directed Reading Program
Welcome to the Neural Representations DRP. Here are resources/ experiments relating to how computers represent abstract concepts. In particular, our focuses are on representational alignment using embedding geometry, and alignment metrics between representations.

## Resources

### Representational Alignment

### Alignment Metrics

This week, the aim is to familiarise yourself with pytorch, and to try and implement the simple linear regression task on cross-lingual data. Perhaps the biggest hurdle will be in downloading the embedding model/data, so there is some artifical data in XXXX. That being said, it would be nice to recreate some results so those of you who are more confident in using PyTorch can begin to implement some of the results in the experiments folder.
